# Vite SSR App with Vuetify rendered using AWS Lambda

This template demonstrates a Vite Server Side Rendered App with Vuetify being rendered using AWS Lambda, and served via Cloudfront.

The SSR Web application includes the use of Vuex and Client Side Routing using Vue Router.

## Getting Started

It is assumed you have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and have setup the credentials (.aws/config & .aws/credentials).

It is recommended that you have previously registered a domain name with Route53 and requested an SSL certificate with AWS Certificate Manager.

*Pro-tip*: When getting a Certificate don't forget to register a wildcard domain as well. ie: *.myawesomedomain.com

Install required components
```
yarn install
```

Edit *env.yml* to reflect your requirements. For example the domain name.

Setup the domain
```
yarn create_domain
```
***Note** this process can take a while*

Deploy the Server Side Rendered (SSR) application
```
yarn deploy
```
Open your browser to https://yourdomain and you should see your Server Side Rendered application.
**This is NOT cached.**

Open the AWS Console and go to the CloudFront tool.

In the list of Distributions there should be a new entry for your project.
Copy the domain name and then open your browser to https://value_from_cloudfront

You should see your Server Side Rendered application.
**This IS cached.**

If you want to make the cached version live then you need to change the entry in Route53 to route your Domain name to the
Cloudfront distribution.
